<!-- GPS 1.2 Reflection
  What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
    Semantic tags enclose content that is all related. It creates distinct areas and helps organize the information. <p>, <h1>-<h6>, <nav> are all tags that would be very useful.
  What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
    The browser displays elements as they're loaded; usually from top to bottom.
  What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
    I learned how to create snippets, which is very useful since my html snippet wasn't working in the first place. I can definitely see myself using snippets more often.

  What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
    Giving and receiving live feedback is still difficult. I think practice will help with that. The technical challenge was all the semantic tags, figuring out when is an appropriate time and where is an appropriate place to use them. Several are similar but not interchangeable. I will read more and look at more examples to help find those distinctions.
