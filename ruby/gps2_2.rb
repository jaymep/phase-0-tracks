# PSEUDOCODE
# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps:
  # [fill in any steps here]
  # 1. create a hash to hold groceries and quantity
  # 2. set default quantity of 1
  # print the list to the console [can you use one of your other methods here?]
  # 3. using .each, loop through hash to print out item and quantity
# output: [what data type goes here, array or hash?]
# hash filled with string/symbols and integer

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: item name and optional quantity
# steps:
  # 1. split up input string
  # 2. add each item to hash as a key, with default value of 1
# output:
  # 1. display newly added item and quantity

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: item name
# steps:
  # 1. find the key in the hash that matches the item name
  # 2. delete that key
# output:
  # 1. print out "removed #{item_name}"

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: item name and new quantity
# steps:
  # 1. find the key in the hash that matches item name
  # 2. updating its' quantity
# output:
  # 1. item name and new quantity

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: hash of groceries
# steps:
  # 1. loop through each key
  # 2. print out each key(item name) and value (quantity)
# output:
  # 1. print out "Item: #{item_name} - Quantity: #{quantity}"

# Tester code:
# grocery_list = create_list("carrots apples cereal pizza")
# puts grocery_list

# update_item("cookies", 3, grocery_list)
# update_item("carrots", 0, grocery_list)
# update_item("apples", 5, grocery_list)

# puts remove_item("carrots", grocery_list)

# print_list(grocery_list)

# Driver code:
groceries = create_list()
update_item("Lemonade", 2, groceries)
update_item("Tomatoes", 3, groceries)
update_item("Onions", 1, groceries)
update_item("Ice Cream", 4, groceries)

update_item("Lemonade", 0, groceries)
update_item("Ice Cream", 1, groceries)

print_list(groceries)

# Reflection:
# What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
# -- There are important things like input, output and format that should be included when writing pseudocode. It doesn't have to  be detailed, but the finer the granularity,  the easier it is to write the initial solution.
# What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
# -- Hashes enabled us to store items and quantities, but figuring out how to parse the information and declare default quantities needed more thought. Arrays are easier to set up, but figuring out how to turn array values into hash keys is not so basic.
# What does a method return?
# -- The result of the last statement executed
# What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
# -- Arrays, hashes, strings, integers, other methods
# How can you pass information between methods?
# -- A variable created and called in each method.
# What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
# -- Refactoring and pseudocode make more sense. Methods as arguments make sense. I still need to get more familiar with variable scope.
