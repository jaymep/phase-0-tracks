# 9.3 jQuery
## Release 0: Make a Plan
### PLAN THE THING (10 MINUTES MAX)
* Pick 2-3 websites. Don't get overwhelmed by the entire internet. 
  * At least one with documentation/references and one for tutorials/examples.
  * Find cheat sheets for personal reference when working on projects
* Work through tutorials/examples to reinforce concepts in documentation/references. Reading and doing - appeals to multiple learning styles! 
  * At minimum try out the stuff that seems interesting.
  * Start with accessing things. Then changing things. Then saving things. Then random fun things. Start small and then build.
* Take breaks after every few examples or each long tutorial. 
  * Pomodoro, if necessary. 
  * Stand up and look away from the screen. 
  * Stretch.

## Release 1: Study Up
### LEARN THE THING (2 HOURS MAX)
Time to execute your plan. Aaaand ... go! When the time is up, record in notes.md which strategies seemed to be the most effective.

## Release 2: Make a Thing
### DO THE THING (45 MINUTES MAX)
Make a jQuery project and add it to the jquery directory. It can be tiny, and it can do whatever you like, as long as you can say in good faith that you're practicing what you've learned and improving your jQuery skills.
