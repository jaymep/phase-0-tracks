# 9.1 How the Web Works
## Release 1: Research Web Servers
### What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
* It's open-source, free, no cost-per-machine. Lots of ports are available for use. It's widely used, so it plays well with OSX and Windows.

### In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
* It's part of a computer that is partitioned and run as a separate computer/server. You don't have rely on a hosting service. You are in control of the configuration. You can use your terminal to access the server terminal. You don't need hardware. It's easy to maintain and inexpensive to start. If something goes wrong, you can rebuild. Opening ports is less risky because the only files available are the ones that were uploaded to the server.

### Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
* The root user has access to everything (super user role). It's more secure to have a separate user account.
